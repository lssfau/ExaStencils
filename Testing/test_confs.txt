# configuration file for automatic tests

# a single line (which represents a single test config) must have one of the following two structures:
# ID   MainClass   KnowledgeInput
# ID   MainClass   KnowledgeInput  ResultFile NoMPINodes NoOMPThreads

# neither of the fields must contain a white space, a tabular, or similar
# ID is an arbitrary string to name the test
# MainClass is the main class of the scala code generator that should be used (without .class ending)
# KnowledgeInput is a text file containing all relevant configurations
# ResultFile is a text file containing the expected output of the generated code
# both KnowledgeInput and ResultFile must be relative to the directory this file is located in
# NoMPINodes and NoOMPThreads are the numbers of the required MPI nodes or OMP threads respectively

# Note: NoMPINodes corresponds to the number of MPI ranks, not the number of physical nodes

# if the last three fields are not set (as in the first structure above), the
# generated code is only compiled, but not executed
