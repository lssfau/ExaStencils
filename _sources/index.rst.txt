Welcome to the ExaStencils code generation framework.
ExaStencils employs a source-to-source compiler written in Scala and also provides it's own
layered domain-specific language (DSL) which is geared towards the class of stencil codes.
The often more abstract DSL program specifications are then provided as input to the generator,
which then applies several code transformations and finally emits highly parallel and efficient C++ code as output.

For further information, please visit our `home page <https://www.exastencils.fau.de/>`_.
In order to get started with ExaStencils, we recommend visiting our `user tutorials page <https://www.exastencils.fau.de/sphinx/tutorials/ExaStencils/index.html>`_ first.
