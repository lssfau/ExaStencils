- The solver's total runtime can be approximated by the product of the required number of cycles and the time required per cycle
- The number of cycles is directly connected to the achieved convergence
- Convergence
	- Convergence is independent on the size of the problem given that the shape remains identical
	- Convergence is improved by increasing the number of pre- and post-smoothing steps
	- Convergence requires a coarse grid solver that achieves sufficient accuracy
- The time per cycle can be estimated by the time of the single components
- One (typical) cycle consists of the following parts: pre-smoothing, post-smoothing, residual update, restriction, prolongation, coarse grid solving and residual reduction
- Pre- and Post-Smoothing
	- These are typically performed on every level but the coarsest
	- The time required is mostly linearly dependent on the number of pre- and post-smoothing steps
	- The time required per level is often directly proportional to the number of points, i.e. quadratically and cubically dependent on the level for 2D and 3D respectively
	- The time required is often mostly independent of the number of MPI processes
	- The time required can be split into communication and calculation
- Residual Update
	- This is typically performed on every level but the coarsest (on the coarsest level, it is often a part of the coarse grid solver and it has to be modelled differently)
	- The time required per level is often directly proportional to the number of points, i.e. quadratically and cubically dependent on the level for 2D and 3D respectively
	- The time required is often mostly independent of the number of MPI processes
	- The time required can be split into communication and calculation (although the communication steps can be moved to other steps as well)
- Restriction and Prolongation
	- These are typically performed on every level but the coarsest
	- The time required per level is often directly proportional to the number of points, i.e. quadratically and cubically dependent on the level for 2D and 3D respectively
	- The time required is often mostly independent of the number of MPI processes
	- The time required can be split into communication and calculation (although the communication steps can be moved to other steps as well)
- Coarse Grid Solving
	- This is usually only performed on the coarsest level
	- This has to be adapted to the underlying structure of the domain
	- The time required is dependent on the number of coarse grid unknowns and thus usually also the number of MPI processes
- Residual Reduction
	- This is usually carried out only once per interation and only on the finest level
	- The time required is dependent on the number of MPI threads
	
- The performance of MPI functions is often dependent on the chosen MPI implementation
